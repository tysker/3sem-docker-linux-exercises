# LINUX COMMANDS EXERCISES

This repository contains exercises to practice linux commands.

For running the exercises you need to have a linux machine or in case
that you have a MAC or Windows machine you can just use a docker container.

Follow the instructions below to get started.

1. clone `3sem-docker-linux-exercises` repository from GitHub
2. open a bash terminal or a command prompt inside your 3sem-docker-linux-exercises` project
3. run `docker build -t linux/env .
4. run `docker run -it --name mylinuxenv linux/env`
5. now you should be inside the container. To get out, you just prompt `exit`
6. If you want to use the same container again, you just have to do the following:
   - `docker start mylinuxenv`
   - `docker container exec -it mylinuxenv bash`
